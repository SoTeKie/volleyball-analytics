# Volleyball analytics

This repository is an active work in progress and still not close to completion.

My end goals for this project are:
1. An open-source and easily usable volleyball analytics program for various leagues that don't have the money
to cash out on more expensive solutions.
2. A well-built code-base that would showcase the strengths of tauri and solidJS :)

I'm not at this time making any promises on when and if I will reach those end goals.
