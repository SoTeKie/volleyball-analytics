The syntax of the statistics has to be:
1. relatively simple
2. easily parsable
3. deterministic 
4. simplifyible

Initial proposal based on how different applications handle it:

[team-prefix][player-number][action][action-specifier]

ACTIONS:
- Serve [S]
- Serve receive [R]
- Pass [P]
- Set [E]
- Hit [H]
- Block [B]
- Freeball [F]

ACTION SPECIFIERS:
- SCORING:
	- If a point is ambigious (can happen if you use the simplest syntax), it might be necessary
		to denote who scored a point, you can do that by suffixing who won the point by using their team-prefix :)
- ZONES: 
	- 1 through 6 [Or 9] and subsections [A-D]
	- 0 -> out of bounds
	- N -> NET (Mostly used for offensive actions)
	- V - OVERPASS (Mostly used for devensive actions) 
	- Can be prefixed with team-prefix on certain actions where it's ambiguous (blocking)
- HEIGHT (Mostly used on defensive actions):
	- L -> Low
	- M -> Mid
	- H -> High
- Serve:
	- SERVE_POSITION:
		- A THROUGH F
	- {SERVE_POSITION}[ZONES]
- Serve receive:
	- [ZONES][HEIGHT]
- Pass:
	- [ZONES][HEIGHT]
- Set:
	- QUALITY:
		- Not sure about this one, maybe zone + speed instead?
		- A THROUGH F
	- [QUALITY]
- Hit:
	[ZONES]
- Block:
	- [ZONES]
- Freeball:
	- [ZONES]

Example with team prefixes:
Team A: !
Team B: @
